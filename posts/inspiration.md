This project was inspired by many factors. I wanted to have my a blog. I wanted to talk about success and my journey towards becoming a Software Engineer through SEI. And I wanted to take my React skills to the *Next* level.

SEI is a course taken through General Assembly where you can learn **Full-Stack Software Engineering** through any of their online, and campus, courses.

React was the tool I used to design this Blog. I love React for it's easy to use library and intuitive nature. It really does make the whole front end development process a lot more fun!

Next JS was the framework used to structure app. What's really cool about it is that it comes with pre-rendering through Static Site Generation and Server Side Rendering. With pre-rendering your page loads much quicker because it is sent to the browser before the JavaScript is loaded, whereas, React must download completely before it is viewable.


Some other tools I'm using to build this app include:

* Reason-React (ReasonML => OCamel)
* React-Bootstrap
